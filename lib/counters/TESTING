In order to test the counters.c module, run "make", which will create the file
counterstest. The program creates two new counters modules and inserts several
different integers into one of the counters. It then retrieves some of the
counter values and prints them. When counterstest is ran, the ouptut is as
follows:

1
2
0
0
0

The output correctly corresponds to what we would expect from the counters
functions.

When we run "valgrind counterstest" after running counterstest itself, valgrind
shows that there are no memory leaks.
