In order to test the bag.c module, run "make" which will create
the file bagtest. The program creates a new bag and inserts and removes
several different strings, printing out the strings to the user as it
removes them. When bagtest is ran, the output is as follows:
hello again
goodbye
hello

The output correctly corresponds to what we would expect from the
bag's functions.
