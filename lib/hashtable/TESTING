In order to test the hashtable.c module, run "make", which will create the
executable file hashtabletest. The program creates a new empty hashtable and
inserts various keys into it with corresponding data. The program then attempts
to find many of these keys in the hashtable later, and prints out their data
and hash value if found. When run with the number of slots equaling 7, the
output for hashtabletest is as follows:

5 test
0 bye
10 goodbye world
6 waterman
6 Waterman

The program works for varying array sizes, not just 7.
The output for this program correctly corresponds to what we would expect from
the hashtable functions.
