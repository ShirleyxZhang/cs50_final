In order to test the list.c module, run "make" in the list directory, which
will create the executable file listtest. The program creates a new, empty list
and inserts and finds various strings in the list. The program prints strings
if found, but if the key was never inserted into the list, the program prints
nothing for that key. However, for each search, the program later prints the
value of the boolean returned by list_find. When listtest is run, the output
is as follows:

test
goodbye
1
1
0

The output correctly corresponds to what we would expect from the list
functions.
